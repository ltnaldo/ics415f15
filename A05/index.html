    <h3>Playing with HTML5 + CSS.</h3>
    <p>HTML5 supports all new features, including images with captions, among others. This page tests out these features.
      HTML5 makes it convenient to format sections of the site, including the header, footer, navigation bar, etc.</p>
    <p>CSS also helps you do crazy things to different elements on the website. You can play around with text colors,
      font stylez, background colors, heights (make it dizzying and new)... do all sorts of crazy stuff with it.</p>

      the surface of what HTML5 could offer, son?). </p>
